r"""Regression gate for `clean_data`'s transient RAM and wall time.

`clean_data` was measured holding 42.68 GB of transient RSS -- the single largest
contributor to the wrapper's host-RAM peak -- while fitting a 666,667 x 2,000
float32 table. That measurement came from the wrapper-wide `profiler.py` in
fomo-fitting's `experimental/arthur/res-2439-reduce-the-ram-footprint-of-the-wrapper/`;
this script isolates the same call so it can be iterated on without paying for a
whole fit + predict.

By default it measures exactly the array that profiler hands to `clean_data`: an
all-numeric float32 table, which is the case the RAM spike was found in. `--mix`
swaps in one of two tables that reach `clean_data` as an object array, as mixed data
really does, so a change can be told apart from a float-only one:

* `half-string` alternates numeric and low-cardinality string columns, so the
  ordinal encoder is actually exercised rather than selecting nothing.
* `numeric-object` alternates float and integer columns. Nothing is encoded, but
  every column still has to be recast, which leaves the frame split into one block
  per column -- the layout pandas has to materialise before it can hand the values
  back, and so the one where a copy of that is worth avoiding.

Each mix keeps its own baseline, and `--mix all` runs all three of them.

What it measures:

* **Transient RSS** -- the peak process RSS reached inside the call, minus the RSS
  on entry, sampled by a background thread so a spike that is allocated and freed
  between two boundaries is still caught. RSS rather than tracemalloc because the
  copies under suspicion are numpy/pandas buffers, invisible to Python's allocator.
* **Wall time** -- `torch.utils.benchmark`, median over `--timing-repeats` calls,
  after `--warmup-calls` untimed ones.

Both metrics, plus the full outputs, are written to a directory named after the
input shape. On a later run that finds a complete set of files there, the script
switches to gate mode: the new run must not use more transient RSS, must not take
longer, and must produce identical outputs, or it exits non-zero. Each check runs
as soon as its input exists, so a regression fails before the next (more expensive)
stage is paid for. Passing overwrites the baseline.

Smoke test locally (seconds, ~20 MB on disk; `--mix` combines with it):

    uv run scripts/bench_clean_data.py --small

`clean_data` is pure CPU work -- pandas and numpy, no device involved -- so the
partition to use is a high-memory CPU one. `cpuhighmem16spot` has 300 nodes at ~123 GB,
so it is both big enough for the full shape and quick to get hold of:

    srun -p cpuhighmem16spot --mem=0 --time=01:00:00 \
        uv run scripts/bench_clean_data.py

Either object-array mix, at the smaller shape they force (see `--mix`):

    srun -p cpuhighmem16spot --mem=0 --time=01:00:00 \
        uv run scripts/bench_clean_data.py --mix half-string

Or every mix in one command -- a child process each, tabled together at the end, so a
change is answered for on all three tables rather than the one it was written against:

    srun -p cpuhighmem16spot --mem=0 --time=02:00:00 \
        uv run scripts/bench_clean_data.py --mix all --reference main

Every mix in such a run is measured whether the ones before it passed or not, and one
that trips a gate reports nothing for the checks after it -- so `--tolerance 0.05` is
worth passing when what is wanted is the whole table rather than the gate.

`--mix all` covers the column axis. The other axis worth covering before believing a
change is the supported dependency range, since what this costs -- and occasionally
what it returns -- depends on what numpy and pandas do underneath. `--environment`
takes that one: `lowest` and `highest` are its two ends, built here on first use the
way CI builds its own two legs, and `current` is this interpreter, named so it can sit
in the grid beside them.

    srun -p cpuhighmem16spot --mem=0 --time=04:00:00 \
        uv run scripts/bench_clean_data.py --mix all --reference main \
            --environment lowest --environment highest

The first use of `lowest` or `highest` resolves and downloads a virtualenv under
`--environment-root`, which takes a couple of minutes and a few GB of disk (torch
brings its CUDA wheels either way); later runs reuse it, and `--refresh-environments`
rebuilds it. `LABEL=PYTHON` measures under an interpreter of your own instead. Each
environment but `current` keeps its baselines in a subdirectory of `--out-root` of its
own, because one recorded against a different dependency set is not comparable with it.

The full numeric shape needs ~20 GB of RAM and writes ~11 GB per run. Pair either with
`scripts/srun_retry.py` when allocations are getting stuck CONFIGURING.

# removes that: it measures a reference commit and the working tree back to back on
# one machine, minutes apart, with the same harness.
#
# The reference package is selected for a whole child process, by putting the
# worktree's `src` on its `PYTHONPATH`. Two alternatives do not work:
#
# * Importing the reference under a second module name (`tabpfn_ref.clean`): the
#   codebase is full of absolute `from tabpfn...` imports, so the reference module
#   would pull its helpers from the *installed* package and silently run a mixture of
#   the two versions.
# * `uv run --project <worktree>`: hermetic, but the worktree has no `uv.lock` (it is
#   gitignored) and `exclude-newer` is a *relative* date, so it resolves its own
#   dependency set -- measured here as numpy 2.5.1 / pandas 3.0.5 / torch 2.13.0
#   against the working tree's 2.4.6 / 3.0.3 / 2.12.0. Since what is being measured
#   is how much copying pandas does, comparing across pandas versions answers a
#   different question than the one asked.
#
# `PYTHONPATH` wins over the editable install because its entries precede the ones
# site-processing appends for a `.pth` file. That is an assumption about the
# environment rather than a guarantee, so it is not trusted: each side records the
# `tabpfn` it actually imported and the comparison verifies both before believing any
# number, along with the library versions the two sides ran against.

# already grew and fragmented, and would have its transient read against that. A
# second interpreter is a child process by definition. Under `--reference` each cell's
# child spawns the usual two grandchildren, so comparing every mix against a commit is
# six measured processes.
#
# The children are handed this run's own argv with `--mix` substituted, rather than a
# spec resolved here: each mix carries its own default shape, and forwarding the flags
# verbatim is what lets every child apply its own. (`--reference`'s two children are
# the opposite case -- there the spec is resolved up front precisely so the two sides
# cannot disagree about what they measured.)
